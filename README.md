# **Dice Stimulator project**

*In this project, I developed a dice simulator using Python, designed to mimic the rolling of a dice. 
This simple yet engaging project was created in a Jupyter Notebook and utilized the random library to generate random outcomes.*



1. Implementation -- 
*Library Used: "random"*

> Imported the random library to leverage its random number generation capabilities.

> Defined a function to simulate the roll of a dice, generating a random integer between 1 and 6.
>
 *First self project for my Portfolio.*
